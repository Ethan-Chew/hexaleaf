# Hexaleaf
Why does [NanoleafÂ® Elements Hexagon](https://nanoleaf.me/en-SG/products/nanoleaf-elements/?category=elements&pack=smarter-kit&size=7) cost $400SGD?? I'm.. pretty sure I can recreate it for a fraction of the price. That was essentially how I started working on my first hardware project :)

Hexaleaf was created using [WLED](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED) and a ESP32-S3 Microcontroller. I've 3D modelled each 'leaf', and added them into this repository if you are interested in creating one yourself! The parts and components I've used are also listed down below.
Through this project, I've learnt so much about working on hardware, and will definitely work on more projects like this in the future! Currently... I'm still working on it, but I'll add in some images when I'm done!

## 3D Files
Hexaleaf Acrylic -- To be used when laser cutting the acrylic cover of the 'leaf', a frosted acrylic sheet can be used to diffuse the light better
Hexaleaf Frame -- 3D model of the frame of a 'leaf'

## Components
1. 1x ESP32-S3 Microcontroller (any microcontroller compatible with WLED will work fine!)
2. 5m WS2812b LED Light Strips
3. 5V 5A Power Supply
4. 8 Channel Logic Level Converter (3.3V to 5V)
